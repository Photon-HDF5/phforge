description: This is a dummy dataset which mimics smFRET data.

setup:
    num_pixels: 2                # number single-pixel detectors
    num_spots: 1                 # number of confocal excitation spots
    num_spectral_ch: 2           # 2 for donor and acceptor detection
    num_polarization_ch: 1       # 1 = no polarization selection
    num_split_ch: 1              # 1 = no beam splitting
    modulated_excitation: False  # CW excitation, no modulation
    lifetime: False              # no TCSPC in detection

photon_data:
    timestamps_specs:
        timestamps_unit: 10e-9  # 10 ns
